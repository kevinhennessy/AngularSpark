# AngularSpark
Demos for Beginners Guide to Angular 2.0 talk at Spark Conference, Charlotte on June 6.  These demos are basically the TypeScript versions of what you can find on http://angular.io (plus an ngConf demo by Microsoft) with a few tweaks that I made to get them working for me.

For guided setup of Angular 2.0 developer preview and TypeScript 1.5 beta (which are used in these demos), watch this video from the Angular team https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmWm21cCAXM  The presenter Alex Eagle is using Visual Studio Code.

The slides for the presentation can be found at http://kevinhennessy.github.io/angular2.
